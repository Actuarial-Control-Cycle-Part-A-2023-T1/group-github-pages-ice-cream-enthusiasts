## Objectives<a id="Objectives"></a>
The main objectives of our proposed program design is to create an effective and efficient 
relocation program that reduces overall severity of natural disasters on Storslysia. Our aim is 
to promote relocation to individuals that live in high-risk areas whilst providing effective 
coverage when a natural disaster does occur. Our program focuses on two key parts; a 
relocation program and claim coverage. The relocation program allows individuals to be 
provided with financial assistance to encourage relocation, reducing the severity of natural 
disasters. The coverage provides a breakdown to everything the insurance program covers 
and the benefits it provides.

## Key metrics<a id="Key-metrics"></a>
The relocation has a planned duration of 7 years, but the services and supports for relocated 
households may run for more than 7 years.
- Number of households relocated – report frequency: quarterly
- Society’s acceptance of the project, which can be measured by the registration rate –
report frequency: quarterly 
- Current cost of the scheme and its comparison to budget – report frequency: half-yearly
- Success rate of relocation, which includes safety of relocated people and the average 
timeframe taken to relocate – report frequency: half-yearly
- Social economic impact of relocation, including but not limited to unemployment rate, 
inflation rate and economic growth rate in each region – report frequency: yearly 
- Satisfaction of relocated people – report frequency: yearly
- True impact of hazard events and its comparison to projected impact of hazard events 
with and without the relocation project – report frequency: yearly

## Program Design<a id="Program-Design"></a>
The proposed program aims to relocate citizens of Storslysia from regions of high risk to
areas with a lower probability of natural disasters. To identify the regions, the program will
assign each region a score based on the overall severity and frequency of natural disasters in
that area. The program will prioritise the relocation of people from the highest-risk regions,
followed by those from the second-highest risk regions until no more relocation is
necessary. We believe that the program will generally relocate population from the three
bottom ranked regions to the three top ranked regions. The program will also provide
financial and psychological assistance to those who file a claim due to natural disasters. The
program has been split into two parts, namely voluntary and proactive, and involuntary
relocation, each with specific requirements that must be met.

Voluntary/proactive relocation aims to encourage people to move to safer areas before a
climate event happens. A citizen that has voluntarily or proactively relocated would have
moved from an area identified as high risk to an area with lower risk based on our analysis.

The program developed a set of rules which defines the requirements for an individual to file a claim anmd the benefits covered by the programs.

### Quantitative Justification<a id="Quantitative Justification"></a>
- Frequency of Natural Disasters: Due to the high probability of natural disasters in various
regions which may cause property damage, injury and death, relocating citizens from high
to low risk areas reduces the likelihood of those three factors.
- Severity of Natural Disasters: Proactive relocation is cheaper than involuntary relocation,
though coverage is provided for both. Due to the severity of the natural disasters,
incentives to proactively can reduce the severity of the natural disaster.
- Individuals with lower socio-economic status are often the most vulnerable after severe
natural disasters. The program’s prioritisation of these individuals ensures that those at
most risk receive the necessary
help first.
- From the most current data, these
are some statistics about Storslysia.

### Qualitative Justification<a id="Qualitative Justification"></a>
- Economic Impact: Due to the funds restriction, coverage has been tiered to ensure that
those in high risk areas can be treated. Although individuals in high risk areas may see a
higher coverage which may reduce incentive to move, we believe that people place a
higher emphasis on their life and individual property rather than willingly wait for the
natural disaster. The coverage for high risk areas is mainly for those who are unwilling or
unable to relocate.
- Societal Impact: Reduction of property damage, injury and loss of life is at the forefront of
the program. Human life is extremely important, so prioritising human life and injuries
are of the upmost importance.
- Limitations: Limitations are placed on the program so that it provides realistic
expectations on those who may be affected by the natural disaster. It also aims to
provide effective coverage if a natural disaster happens. Due to these factors, the
limitations ensure that the program can operate with effectiveness and efficiency.

## Pricing Methodology<a id="Pricing-Methodology"></a>
To price this relocation program, a score-ranking system was established for each region 
according to their risk profiles on the severity and frequency of natural weather hazards. 
This score is calculated by multiplying a severity measure and frequency measure for a given 
region. After calculating the scores for each region, the regions were ranked by their respective 
scores with the highest being the riskiest while the lowest being the least risky. Hence, it was 
determined that the ranking order for Storslysian regions, from most to least risky, was 2, 5, 
4, 3, 6 and 1. 

Under the scheme, the objective was to relocate 55%, 50% and 25% of households from 
regions 2, 5 and 4 to relatively ‘safer’ regions 3, 6 and 1 respectively. This implied a 
relocation target of 1,795,486 households from regions 2, 5 and 4. Conversely, the maximum 
total available space for the safe regions 3, 4 and 1 was determined to be 1,810,050 houses 
which was sufficient to accommodate the relocated households. Additionally, it was 
assumed that the maximum intake for each regions equates to the maximum available 
houses in each respective regions. 

Additionally, it was also crucial to consider the progress or timeline of the relocation in each 
region which was based on the risk profile ranking of each region. Essentially, the safest 
region with the lowest score was prioritised and so forth. Consequently, this suggests region 
2 was prioritised to be the first relocation destination, followed by region 5 and finally region 
4. The benefit of this prioritisation ordering allows to minimise the economic costs and 
impacts of the occurrences of natural hazards in the future. Moreover, this scheme also 
strives to achieve an even distribution of the total relocation target annually, which amounts 
to 260,000 households to be relocated per year. This is mainly to mitigate any irregular 
economic impacts due to uneven distribution of relocation per year. As a result, this program 
will actively run over a seven year time period. A transition matrix for the household 
relocation discussed above is displayed below:

### Economic cost<a id="Economic cost"></a>
In this section, the projection of economic costs for this relocation scheme will be contrasted 
between two cases: (1) when the relocation scheme is implemented and (2) when there is 
no relocation scheme. For the purpose of simplicity, we will refer to the case where the 
relocation program is implemented as ‘with’ case, and when there is no relocation program 
as the ‘without’ case. A graph of the short term and long term economic costs is illustrated 
below:

### Sensitivity analysis<a id="Sensitivity analysis"></a>
It is difficult to assess which SSP scenarios Storslysia will end up into, it depends on 
government regulations, incentives, infrastructures, land-use planning etc. Therefore, our 
team decides to analyse the impact on economic costs when other probabilities of SSP 
Scenarios combination are applied in comparison with our baseline scenario.

## Data limitation<a id="Data-limitation"></a>
In designing the relocation program for Storslysia, we used the economic demographic, 
emissions and hazard event data. The limitations of these data and corresponding details are 
summarised below.
|Limitation|Description|
|--------|----|
|Limited GDP data|We have only access to the 2019 and 2020 GDP data, making it is difficult to give an accurate estimation of GDP growth rate.|
|Lack of economic, industrial and labour conditions regionally| The model does not account for the economic and industrial conditions in each region, and whether the labour skillsets in a region is applicable to another region, which will result in inaccurate pricing and cost projection of the relocation scheme.|
|Misleading data|We observe -990% in 2003’s inflation rate data, which is likely due to a data error, hence this value is skipped in the model.|
|Limited population data|Census data for each region is only given for 2019, 2020 and 2021, making it difficult to understand and/or predict movement between the regions prior to the program’s commencement.|
